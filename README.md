# sounds_good
C++ console application that creates general sounds from combinations of sine waves. Can readily reproduce the sounds of musical instruments, but any sound should be plausible.

This project is currently under construction and incomplete. Many classes are still useable for applications, however. But documentation is unfinished, as is the implementation of various instruments.
